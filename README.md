# Python User Input
## Task
- Get the customer's details using ```input()```
- Print the data type of their details using ```type()```

## Converting ```input()``` data type
- The default return data type of ```input()``` is a string.
- Using a cast of another data type, such as ```int()```, 
  will change its data type.
- For instance, ```int(input())``` will return the input as 
  an integer.

## Showing the data type of a variable
- ```type()``` will turn the data type of the variable inside.
- For instance, with the variable ```name = "King"```, 
  ```type(name)``` will return ```<class 'str'>```, 
  showing that ```name``` holds a string.
- This can be used to check the data type of literals and 
  objects as well.
